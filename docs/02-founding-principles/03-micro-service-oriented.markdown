# Micro Service Oriented [](id=micro-service-oriented)

Although HyperIoT Framework can also be used to build monolith applications, the main goal is to have an easy-to-use framework for building micro-services.

This means that within the core and tools there will not only be tools for development but also modules to integrate microservices synchronously and asynchronously. One example out of all: it will be possible to implement a SAGA pattern in a simple way using the appropriate class hierarchy.

This framework has solid basis and used in a lot application. Our roadmap provides to insert are µServices related patterns in the future such as: Api Gateway, Service Mesh, Support for SAGA pattern, Certificate Management and rotation, and µServices configuration management. Everything available in one place, written in a modular way so that the final user can customize it for his purpose.
Another interesting field of research would be to implement a generic cluster deployer module for Kubernetes in order to ship and balance microservices automatically based on the current resource consumption updating the service registry automatically.
