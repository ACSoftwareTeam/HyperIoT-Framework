# Domain Driven Design [](id=domain-driven-design)

HyperIoT Framework has as one of its main goals to encourage domain-driven-development by reducing precisely the impact at the development level (DDD is technically more onerous in terms of development costs).

Adopting this approach makes it possible to create easily maintainable and evolvable applications by creating domain separation that reduces coupling and increases cohesion between the various modules. Clearly, there are points of attention to consider during the development phase but with the help of the HyperIoT Generator tool this will be even more simplified.

In fact, during the generation of a project it is possible to:

* Create a domain project
* Add Entities to the project
* Add Aggregates

Ability to automatically generate relationships between entities within the same domain

Taking advantage of the generator is therefore essential to have a complete , secure and evolvable scaffolding of our application.

Clearly DDD is one of the possible approaches, nothing prohibits the developer from using the same tools and creating their own applications following different patterns or approaches.
