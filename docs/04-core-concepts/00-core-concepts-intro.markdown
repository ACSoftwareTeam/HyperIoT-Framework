# Core Concepts [](id=core-concepts)

The framework is based on some simple concepts that allow abstracting many of the logic needed in microservices development.

Everything is based on a basic design, precisely HyperIoTBase. Specifically, in the HyperIoTBase-api module are defined all the abstract concepts underlying the operations of the entire system. Being based on OSGi it is possible at any time to extend and enrich these functionalities.
